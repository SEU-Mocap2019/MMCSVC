# Annotation
+ Remember to use command `cd src` to modify the current path before running the optimization.

+ To  economize memory space, this repository doesn't contain "model.pkl".  
You need to add directory "MMCSVC/model" and add "model.pkl" to it manually.

+ To ensure its normal operation under our virtual environment, we need to add a file "MMCSVC.pth".  
Here is an example under Anaconda3:  
    Directory:
    >/home/roy/anaconda3/envs/py2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/MMCSVC.pth

    "MMCSVC.pth":
    >/home/roy/MMCSVC/src

+ Please don't put our project in directories with Chinese characters.
