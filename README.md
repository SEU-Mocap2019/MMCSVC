# Annotation
This repository doesn't contain "model.pkl".
You need add directory like "MMCSVC/model" to add model.pkl in it.
For our virtual environment, we add MMCSVC.pth
For example:
/home/roy/anaconda3/envs/py2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/MMCSVC.pth
MMCSVC.pth:
/home/roy/MMCSVC/src 
ps:
    please don't put our project in Chinese directory
